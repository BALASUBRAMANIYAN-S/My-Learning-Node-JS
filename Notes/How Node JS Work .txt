**WHAT IS NODE.JS?**

	Definition:
		Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

	Built on:
		It is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine (which makes it very fast).

	Main purpose:
		Node.js lets developers build server-side applications (like APIs, web servers, real-time apps, etc.) using JavaScript.
		
		
	Key Points

		Single-threaded & Event-driven – Handles many requests at the same time without creating multiple threads.

		Non-blocking I/O – Executes tasks asynchronously, so it doesn’t get “stuck” waiting for one request to finish.

		Cross-platform – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.

		Package Manager – Uses npm (Node Package Manager) to install and manage libraries.

		Use case – Building scalable network applications (e.g., chat apps, REST APIs, streaming services).
